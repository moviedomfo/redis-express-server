# Redis Express Server for Demonstrating Redis Usage with Docker 🚀

## Description
The Redis Express Server is a project designed to showcase the diverse applications of Redis, a popular in-memory data store, when deployed within a Docker container. This server exposes a set of APIs to interact with Redis, illustrating how various data structures such as Strings, Sets, Stacks, and Hashes can be utilized effectively.

## Features
1. **String Operations 📜**: This Redis server provides APIs for adding and retrieving string values. You can store and fetch single values efficiently, making it suitable for caching and simple data storage needs.

2. **Set Operations 🧩**: Demonstrates the usage of Redis sets by allowing you to add, remove, and retrieve members from sets. It's a great way to implement unique item collections.

3. **Stack (List) Operations 📦**: Explore how Redis can function as a stack or list by pushing and popping elements. This is useful for tasks such as job queues or managing recent activities.

4. **Hash Operations 🔑**: The server exposes APIs for adding, updating, and retrieving data in Redis hashes. This is ideal for storing and accessing structured data efficiently.

By using this Redis Express Server, developers can grasp the versatility of Redis and learn how to harness its powerful features for various data storage and retrieval needs. Whether you are building a cache, managing unique values, implementing a stack, or working with structured data, Redis within a Docker container simplifies these operations and ensures data persistence. 🛡️
